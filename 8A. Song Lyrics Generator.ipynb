    "- Find a web page that has links to all of the songs, like [this one](http://www.azlyrics.com/n/nirvana.html). [_Note:_ It appears that `azlyrics.com` blocks web scraping, so you'll have to find a different lyrics web site.] Then, you can scrape this page, extract the hyperlinks, and issue new HTTP requests to each hyperlink to get each song. \n",

    "# Question 2. Unigram Markov Chain Model\n",
    "\n",
    "You will build a Markov chain for the artist whose lyrics you scraped in Lab A. Your model will process the lyrics and store the word transitions for that artist. The transitions will be stored in a dict called `chain`, which maps each word to a list of \"next\" words.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if your song was [\"The Joker\" by the Steve Miller Band](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgDU17xqNXo), `chain` might look as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "chain = {\n",
    "    \"some\": [\"people\", \"call\", \"people\"],\n",
    "    \"call\": [\"me\", \"me\", \"me\"],\n",
    "    \"the\": [\"space\", \"gangster\", \"pompitous\", ...],\n",
    "    \"me\": [\"the\", \"the\", \"Maurice\"],\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides words, you should include a few additional states in your Markov chain. You should have `\"<START>\"` and `\"<END>\"` states so that we can keep track of how songs are likely to begin and end. You should also include a state called `\"<N>\"` to denote line breaks so that you can keep track of where lines begin and end. It is up to you whether you want to include normalize case and strip punctuation.\n",
    "\n",
    "So for example, for [\"The Joker\"](https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/stevemillerband/thejoker.html), you would add the following to your chain:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "chain = {\n",

    "    \"Some\": [\"people\", ...],\n",

    "    \"me\": [\"the\", ...],\n",
    "    \"the\": [\"space\", ...],\n",
    "    \"space\": [\"cowboy,\", ...],\n",
    "    \"cowboy,\": [\"yeah\", ...],\n",
    "    \"yeah\": [\"<N>\", ...],\n",
    "    \"<N>\": [\"Some\", ..., \"Come\"],\n",
    "    ...,\n",
    "    \"Come\": [\"on\", ...],\n",
    "    \"on\": [\"baby\", ...],\n",
    "    \"baby\": [\"and\", ...],\n",
    "    \"and\": [\"I'll\", ...],\n",
    "    \"I'll\": [\"show\", ...],\n",

    "The lyrics generated by the bigram model seems more like a BROCKHAMPTON song than the lyrics generated by the unigram model. The grammar is certainly better with the bigram model than with the unigram model. I suppose this is because choosing a word that comes after a pair of words is more specific - there are less words to be followed by a pair of words than a single words. \n",
    "\n",
    "The unigram model creates a smaller chain than the bigram model. But, the results of the bigram model are more meaningful and reasonable because the chain is larger yet more specific. The thing is, BROCKHAMPTON has a lot of repetition and random lyrics than some songs - maybe because that is how Hip Hop goes these days. The unigram model would print too many repeated words. Like one line was \"head head head head head\", because one line in a song repeats \"head\" a few times in a row so there were multiple \"head\"s in the \"head\" key. However, the bigram model handles this well because it adds the word before and after the repeated \"head\" line in the lyrics, thus preventing the algorithm from getting stuck in \"head\" and other lyric patterns like this.
